How do I use this code???

I will explain it step by step:

1. Create a server in Discord and add DiscordRPG#0366  bot to your server. Join the discord server to do so (https://drpg.xyz/Discord)
2. Create a channel in the server that is called "discord-rpg-1" if its anything else it won't work.
3. Create a discord bot and add it to the server. If you don't know how to create one, check first 2 minutes of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqurhm2QxA0 
4.Get the Token of the bot you created.
5.Open an interface where you can write python code. Such as python 3.7 or idle python. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
6. Copy paste the code that I shared.
7.  There is a variable in the 15'th line of the code that is called TOKEN change it with your bots token.
8. Install the packages that are at the top of the code the ones that start with import.
8. Check here to learn how to install https://docs.netapp.com/oci-73/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.oci-ht-all%2FGUID-B91E7C76-5651-4216-A4FD-000A7BBAA98E.html
9. Run the code.
10. When the code is runned it will ask you a question saying "What is the name of the person that is using the bot (without tag and spaces) "
Example: If your name is Kreyto#3024 you should just type "Kreyto" and thats it no gap or anything else with the correct letters and everything.
11. After you type the name wait till the code prints  " we have logged into (yourbot)"
12. Then open the server go to discord-rpg-1 and type #!adv
13. When you want to use the bot again follow the steps 9-10-11-12

Enjoy!
